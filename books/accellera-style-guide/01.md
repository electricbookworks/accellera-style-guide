# 1. Overview

## 1.1 Purpose

This style guide defines the recommended structure, formatting and style to develop and deploy Accellera (Draft) Standards, User Guides and other standard-related documentation.

This style guide is intended for Accellera working group members which are assigned as technical editor to author standard-related documentation. Technical editors are encouraged to contact the Accellera Technical Committee chair for additional guidance and support when developing a standard-related document.

In the case of changes or deviations to the recommended formatting and style as defined in this guide, it is required to contact the Technical Committee chair for approval. Please note that deviations to the formatting and style may result in a delayed approval of the Accellera (draft) standard, or even difficulties to transfer an Accellera standard to the IEEE Standardization Association.

This style guide is not addressing the policies and procedures for the development of Accellera standards. For that, please consult the [Accellera Policies & Procedures](https://www.accellera.org/images/about/policies/Policies_and_Procedures_2021.pdf) which can be found at the [Accellera](https://www.accellera.org/about/policies-and-procedures) website.

## 1.2 Helpful resources

The following documents are helpful resources for writing an Accellera standard-related document.

[IEEE SA Standards Style Manual](https://mentor.ieee.org/myproject/Public/mytools/draft/styleman.pdf)

[Electric Book documentation](https://electricbookworks.github.io/electric-book/docs/)

[Kramdown Quick Reference](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html)

## 1.3 Accellera Documentation Flow

It is strongly recommended to use the [Accellera Documentation Flow (ADF)](https://github.com/OSCI-WG/adf) to develop Accellera standard documents. When using this flow, the required Accellera or IEEE formatting and styles are automatically applied as part of the PDF rendering flow.

Each Accellera working group will use its own GitHub repository to manage the source files of one or more documents. Working groups should contact the Technical Committee chair to request the creation of such documentation repository.

The Accellera Documentation Flow is provided as Docker image. This flow offers the automation to render documents in PDF or HTML format. Technical editors who wish to render these documents should have a local installation of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/). 

Note that installation of the Accellera Documentation Flow is not required when creating or authoring the document sources; in this case access to the GitHub repository and use of an text editor is sufficient.

Please contact the Technical Committee chair in case of questions on the Accellera Documentation Flow, the required installation procedure or use of document styles and templates.
